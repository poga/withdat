# w/dat

A collection of use cases with Dat and its underlying technology

## Why

[dat](https://datproject.org/) is a grant-funded, open-source, decentralized data sharing tool for efficiently versioning and syncing changes to data.

IMO dat and its core technology, [hypercore](https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore) and [hyperdrive](https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperdrive), can be the infrastructure of a decentralized web.

This repo contains a list of projects/prototypes and its potential use cases.
